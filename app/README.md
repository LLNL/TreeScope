### TreeScope, Version 1.0

TreeScope is written in `Javascript` using `d3`. It can be be easily used on any browser, although it has been tested on Chrome 56.0.

#### Installation
To install TreeScope and its dependencies, `npm` (node package manager) needs to be installed. OSX users can use macports to install npm.

```
$ port install nodejs6
$ port install npm3
```

Once `npm` is available, TreeScope can be installed with the following commands.

```
$ pwd
<your_path>/TreeScope/app

$ npm install
$ ./node_modules/.bin/jspm install
```

These command read the dependences from the file `TreeScope/app/package.json`. Please do not edit this file.

#### Execution

To use the tool, you need to start a http server on the localhost.

```
$ pwd
<your_path>/TreeScope/app

$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8888 ...
```

#### Loading Data

By default, the server runs in the `<your_path>/TreeScope/app` directory. Thus, your data path should be **relative** to this directory. An easy way would be to create symlink to your data in this directory. For example,

```
$ pwd
<your_path>/TreeScope/app

$ ln -s /my_data_path/example_data .
```

Then, the tool can be loaded by pointing your browser to the following address:. `localhost:8888/?data=example_data`.
