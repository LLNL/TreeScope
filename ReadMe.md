TreeScope is an interactive, web-based visualization tool for exploring
network traffic on large-scale fat-tree networks. It can be used to explore
congestion in the network, as well as understand its potential causes.
TreeScope provides both summarized and detailed visualization of per-link
network traffic, as well as supports auxiliary visualization of job
placement, useful for hypothesizing about its role in congestion.


`TreeScope/app` contains the core application. Instructions for installation and execution 
are also provided in the same directory. `TreeScope/docs` contains documentation 
on the available features, as well as the data formats 
required by TreeScope.  Tools to convert network data collected from
the interconnect to the TreeScope-friendly format are given in
`TreeScope/tools`.

 If you are interested in using TreeScope, please contact hbhatia@llnl.gov.
